# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

As a new boot camp student this pre work study guide was created to look back on throughout the course. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, GIT and Javascript. I intend on adding more information to this study guide as I move foward, as it will help me succeed in the course. The study guide contains detailed coding hints for HTML, CSS and JS, along with instructions on how to use GIT.

 To use this pre work study guide, you can review the notes in each section. Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. A list of topics we learned from the prework will appear, and you can then choose which topic you would like to learn about.
